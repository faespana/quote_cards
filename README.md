STOP HERE 🛑!! Many times we feel frustrated because we've had a bad day 🌫️ 😶, or maybe because we had problems with a family member or a coworker 😥. And sometimes we just need to talk to someone else who 
gives us those words of support (the real friends are there 🤩💪🏽), or we can also read something that motivates us 🤓 .Well, I present to you a small web app made in React 💙 that I built with great messages of 
support from the main personalities worldwide 👳🏽‍♂️👸🏽🎅🏽🧔🏽‍♀️👩🏽‍🏫🧑🏽‍🔬👨🏽‍ 🚀. It has helped me a lot and every morning before I get up, I read some and then I feel much better and with 100% batteries 😎🤓!!
